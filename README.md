## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer to identify top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. This way, a volunteer can determine whether the Improbable Beef species used for syntehtic beef is in their navel.

## Results
I created a horizontal bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart to visual the top 10 bacterial species.

## Conclusion
Now, once Improbable Beef announces the species used for synthetic beef, each volunteer can check whether it is the same as the bacteria in their navel by using the bacterial subject id Number filter from the drop down.
